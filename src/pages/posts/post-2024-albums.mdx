# Conclusion
Another great year in the books! Hope you liked what I had to say. This page, like me, will live forever so don't worry about bookmarking it.

Don't forget to check out this years [songs list](/posts/post-2023-songs). 50 hot songs without an annoying radio DJ to count them down. Disclaimer: I used to be an annoying radio DJ. There's a playlist to favorite at the bottom too!
