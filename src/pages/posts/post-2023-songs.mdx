Welcome to the top songs of 2023! If you want the Spotify playlist very fast, head to the bottom: <TeenyButton link_text="Jump to bottom" astro_link="#conclusion"/>

## Introduction

I choose these with an eye towards songs I found catchy or experimental and listened to a lot, or music I found to be captivating on a more structural or technical level. The top 16 have a few words of mine about them.

Don't forget to enjoy the albums list as well! <TeenyButton link_text="Album list" astro_link="/posts/post-2023-albums"/>
