1	Wishy	Triple Seven	LP	August 16	August 16	5.0	★★★★★	5.00	dream pop, indie pop, indie rock, shoegaze,	I had first heard about Wishy in late 2023, when Stereogum discussed their great EP from late last last year. Growing immediately hooked, I said to my friends "this album is gonna blow me away in 2024." And I was _right_! could it have been a self-fulfilling prophecy? Absolutely not. But I spent a lot of the year eagerly awaiting this release, and the rest of the year listening to it over and over.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qURgDo93L.jpg
2	Kendrick Lamar	GNX	LP	November 22	November 22	4.5	★★★★✬	4.75	hip-hop, rap, west coast, hip hop,	Kendrick's banner year wraps up with a perfect exclamation mark, capitalizing on his popularity in 2024 to release an incisive and motivated rap album featuring up-and-coming Los Angeles stars.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RmVkSbP7L.jpg
3	Carly Cosgrove 	The Cleanest of Houses Are Empty	LP	June 14	June 20	4.0	★★★★	4.65	midwest emo, emo-pop, emo,	This Carly Cosgrove album, a band so befuddlingly named as to ruin some of my data collection (no, I am not listening to Miranda Cosgrove), was my biggest grower of the year. What started as a comfortingly familiar emo/pop-punk inspired romp really developed into an addicting and listenable album that fit into any time of day where a full-throated sing-a-long was possible.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UbNY8J31L.jpg
